siggenescoreplot(fdmgene,

                 plotname = "FocusedGene",
                 savepath = NA,

                 rescore_thr = 0.8,
                 descore_thr = 0.8)

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fdmgene}{
A dataframe of functional DmM genes' information. It is generated using fdmdeepm6A function.
}
  \item{siggene}{
A vector of the gene symbol of interested genes to visualize
}
  \item{plotname}{
The name of the plot
}
  \item{savepath}{
The file path where to save the result
}
  \item{sigthresh}{
The threshold of the FDR used to determine whether a DmMGene is a FDmMGene
}
  \item{rescore_thr}{
The threshold of relative MSB score percentage used to determine FDmMGenes with relatively higher MSB score
}
  \item{descore_thr}{
The threshold of DE score percentage used to determine FDmMGenes with relatively higher MSB score
}
}
\details{
Visualization of MSB scores along with DE scores of interested genes and FDmMGenes with relatively higher MSB scores and DE scores.
}
\value{
By default, siggenescoreplot will output result of DmMGeneâ€™s MSB score along with DE score.
